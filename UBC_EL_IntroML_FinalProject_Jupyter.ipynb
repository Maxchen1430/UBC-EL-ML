    "Cheese, the delicious creation from combining dairy and fermentation, is often a favoured delicacy or recipe-must-have for many people. However, for those who are more health-conscious or on a dietary/caloric restriction, it may be beneficial to obtain the fat level of the chosen cheese before purchasing/cooking with it. Therefore, as a cheese-lover and someone who is trying to lose weight and become healthier, I hope to answer the question: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Would it be possible to train a machine learning model to predict the fat level, as \"high\" or \"low,\" in cheese? And if so, which model would work best as measured by mulitple scoring metrics, including \"accuracy,\" \"recall,\" \"precision,\" and \"f1 score\"?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to answer the afore-mentioned questions by testing different machine learning models, such as **DummyClassifier** and **KNeighborsClassifier**, wtih additional scoring metrics beside \"accuracy\", like **recall**, **precision**, and **f1 score**. Given that the provided \"cheese_data\" data set categorizes fat level as \"high level\" and \"low level,\" the goal of this project will be better achieved with classification models rather than regression, as the end result should display either of the two labels. Much like other real world data sets, the \"cheese\" data set may include possible class imbalance issue, which if so, we will discuss how to address this problem later on in the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "My expected project outcome would be a **RandomizedSearchCV** model built with a **RandomForestClassifier** pipeline and additional parameters to ensure better overall scoring accuracy; additional measurement, such as a confusion matrix and classification report will be created to ascertain if my expectation is indeed correct or false."

    "As many of the summaries of different visualizations have mentioned, there is a potential class imbalance issue with the \"cheese\" data set, and a balanced-class-weight counter-measure will likely help with easing the imbalance, although at the expense of more false positive predictions. As with many other data sets and analyses that suffer from class imbalance issues, the overall accuracy score may not be the most effective metric to weigh the efficiency of models. Instead, we should use metrics such as **recall**, **precision**, and **f1 scores** to better assess the potential models; these metrics focus on the different positives, and the harmonic mean of precision combined with recall, without putting the sole focus on overall accuracy regardless of the proportions of examples outnumbering others.

    "The outcome of the project can be coined as somewhat satisfactory as we do have a model that can predict the fat level in cheese fairly well at a weighted average f1 score of 0.84, although the class imbalance issue, despite not severely hampering the effectiveness of the model, still persists. When working with real-world data sets, it is often difficult to fully eliminate the problem of class imbalance, at least not without changing the data gathering methods or process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model, despite how well it performs given the circumstance, is still flawed, as descriptive columns were stripped from both the training and testing sets. \"FlavourEn,\" \"CharacteristicsEn,\" and \"RindTypeEn\" columns, and their content contained within, all likely included information that can increase the accuracy of the model; while I do not regret excluding them due to technical complexity, the outcome and scores could have become more satisfactory with them included. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the project outcome is satisfactory enough, there are other additional methods or ideas that can further increase the overall scoring accuracy; one such an idea was to compare each entry from \"y_test\" to the corresponding prediction from the RandomizedSearchCV model, and assess if each individual prediction was correct or not. Without additional learning or programming training, I sadly was not able to include that idea in the porject itself, as the best I could do was to tally up a total count of prediction accuracy while omitting any possibility of false positive or false negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the goal of the project has been achieved as there is now a model capable of making somewhat accurate predictions of fat level in cheese, albeit with certain information excluded from the process and some details omitted due to technical difficulty and concern for too much complexity in execution."
